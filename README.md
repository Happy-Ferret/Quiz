Quiz
====

Codebase for a quiz game. Created as part of a class assignment. A JSON template is included.

######Note: 
The way the JSON document is set up, <b>option1</b> should always provide the correct answer to the question at hand. 
The javascript part of the codebase will then do its best to randomise between the four options.

#####Versions:

* v0.9: Basic "no frills" release.
* v1:   Adds custom reply feature according to issue #3. 
* v1.1: Adds slider timer feature (longer replies stay on the screen for a longer time).
