This directory contains the .nsi script the Windows installer is built from,
the applicable license the game's binary files are released under as well as the graphical icon used by the installer itself.

The license only applies to the binaries shipped with specific copies released by me.
Feel free to replace License.rtf with whatever license suits you the most. 

######Note: 
The .nsi file uses "Quiz" as a kind of placeholder. You would be wise to replace all instances of "Quiz" with a unique name.
